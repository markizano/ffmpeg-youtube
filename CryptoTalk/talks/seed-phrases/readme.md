# Seed Phrases vs Private Keys
In this video, we're going to see what made my head explode.
This is absolutely insane.

First, we need to clear up a few things: The difference between a seed phrase and a private key.

## Private Keys
We've talked about PKI before on this channel, but I'm going to introduce you to a new concept.
You know that your private key is what sends your crypto to other places on the network, but did
you know you can generate your private keys from your seed phrase???

You can think of your private keys as the binary stuff that makes crypto possible.

## Seed Phrase
Your seed phrase is what generates those private keys. We're going to take a look at a tool that will
help us see the difference between the two and how you can use this to your advantage and save yourself
some gas fees with Ethereum.

## Saving gwei on ETH
In order to save you some fees in gas from transferring your coin from one wallet to another, did
you know you can import your wallet from one software to another?

*boom*

## Disclaimer
I must stress the importance of understanding what you are doing with this. This is not for the feint
of heart and not for new beginners in cryptocurrency. Every time you expose the private keys, you expose
yourself to having your crypto completely wiped from your wallet with no refunds.
So please, do take extreme caution.

## The Idea
The idea here is to export your secrets from Exodus so you can import them into Metamask.

## Demo
Let's walk through a demo here. Let's open a local wallet we control like Exodus.
We'll create a wallet and allow it to catch up to the blockchains.
Once it's setup, we navigate to the Ethereum wallet.
The Ethereum wallet grants us a button that let's us view the private keys for this chain specifically.
Once we view the secret phrase that generated this wallet, we can import that into Metamask.

Enter: BIP39 - the definition of the mnemonic phrase.
