SEC Chairman Gary Gensler says that we may have approval for a BitCoin ETF here soon.
The vote was set to take place this month but was pushed out 45 days from OCT01.

This is an interesting ETF because it won't actually hold any Bitcoin, it'll be based on Bitcoin
"Futures Contracts", which could indirectly impact the price of the coin.

It'll rise and fall with the coin, however, they will be diverting from the original goal of Bitcoin,
which was to decentralize the system so people couldn't manipulate the price.
