# BITO: The new BitCoin ETF approved for the NASDAQ.
So let's talk about BITO: A Bitcoin ETF!
---
The ticker symbol BITO is for the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF.
This ETF will not be what you'd expect since it's not a traditional ETF.
In most cases, when you buy into an ETF, it will go and buy an equivalent amount of the underlying
asset. If there are underlying stocks, real estate, or precious metals like gold and silver, the ETF
would go and purchase the actual underlying asset.
---
Starting Tuesday, OCT 19th, BITO went public on the market. This ETF will instead purchase futures
contract to acquire Bitcoin at a later date.
The ETF has a limit of 2000 contracts available for investors per month.
---
A futures contract is fancy words for call and put options in the stock market against Bitcoin's price.
After the contracts are secured and executed, they will go acquire said Bitcoin.
---
Indirectly, this can impact the price of Bitcoin, but not in the way you would think and by no means
would it be predictable nor consistent for at least five years (personally, I believe).
---

This does two major things that I see:
- It gives institutions that must abide by financial governance ability to invest in Bitcoin without
  owning it.
- It re-creates the same issue with gold into fiat in that they are dilluting the value of a promise
  in place of the actual asset itself.
