# Myth: Cryptocurrency is used for illegal activities and skirting paying on taxes.
Yeah, Fiat currencies like USD are completely immune from that.
Using cash to pay for drugs off the street totally never happens, right?
Storing cash overseas and in other countries isn't a means and an end to avoid paying taxes on USD isn't a thing, right?

The thing is: People are going to try to preserve their wealth, by legal or illegal
means regardless of the asset, platform, or name of whatever you call "value".

If it was exclusively for illegal purposes, then why has the SEC approved a BitCoin Futures ETF with the possibility
of approving a Spot ETF? Seems at least Bitcoin is being recognized as an official currency and the Gov't wants to
get involved in this now.

So, when some media talks about Cryptocurrency being exclusively for illegal purposes, they aren't giving you the
full context.
This why it's important to maintain an open mind to think about the possibilities once you
learn something new.
