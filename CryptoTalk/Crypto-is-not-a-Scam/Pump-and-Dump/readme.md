# Myth: Cryptocurrency is all about the pump and dump. There's no real gains that can be made from it because people just want to steal your money.
Pump and Dumps are not unique to crypto. People in the stock market will pump and dump
stocks all the time. This isn't unique to cryptocurrency. Just look at AMC and GME from FEB of 2021.
Sure, that incident involved a lot of retail investors, but they did that in retaliation to what
folks on Wall Street do all the time and make a lot of bank.
Am I the only one who remembers the nonstop, incessant talks about Enron Corp?
Did we not just see this happen with the 2008 housing market crash? Was that not a pump and dump of the real estate market as an asset class?

So yes, there will be those patterns everywhere. The thing you need to be aware of is to avoid those things.
If you have a bad gut feeling about where you want to put your money, then just DON'T GO THRU WITH IT!
