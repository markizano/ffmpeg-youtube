# Dilema: Growth Stocks vs Dividends

Edited for brievety; link to full video in the pinned comment below.

Hi Andrei, my name is Markizano Draconus. Hope you're doing well.
Come for the crypto and stay for the answer to the burning question!

I talk a lot about Crypto Theory, however, I think talking about the finance aspect of it is just as important.

It sounds to me like it would be a good idea to invest in growth stocks to build your capital and
when you are ready, divert yourself to a conservative approach and build up that passive divident
investment to cover your expenses over time.

It'll take a minimal amount of work to ensure those dividends continue to flow in the case of recession
and companies have to start cutting their dividends...

As you say, Dividends are a priviledge, not a right :shrug:

(since they are just the extra money the company
doesn't have anything better to do with than to return that to the shareholders.)

The question sounds like it's framed to make a choice between the two.
To that, I say why have "or" when you can have "and"?

Your stock selections are not immutable and can change at the click of a button.

Now, if you're looking for a hedge against a potential recession, I recommend checking out Joseph Hogue
with the Let's Talk Money channel ;)
He has several videos covering the subject and giving you ways to protect against these kinds of things.

Also, btw: Do you have a presence on TikTok?
I think you would make a great addition talking about Finance and giving short tips here and there.
You could also use TikTok as a preview to the entailing YouTube to follow 8)
